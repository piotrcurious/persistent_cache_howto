# persistent_cache_howto
Nice question — you want persistent, measurable, and session-aware secondary caching on Linux (lots of RAM, slow disk). My top recommendation is to use a block-level, persistent cache engine for the heavy lifting, and add a lightweight file-access profiler + a small “warming/pinning” orchestration layer that builds a session-specific hot-list and applies it (and can re-apply it at boot). That combination meets your three hard requirements (persistence across reboots, on-demand latency measurement, per-session file recording + optimization).

Below I give (A) the single best practical choice, (B) a second option, (C) a concrete architecture/workflow you can implement right away, and (D) short concrete commands / a tiny script to bootstrap the session pipeline.

A — Primary recommendation (best fit)

Open CAS (Open Cache Acceleration Software) as the persistent secondary (block) cache, managed with its casctl/casadm tools.

Why Open CAS for your case

It is a purpose-built, kernel / userland caching stack with a config file and autostart support so cache/core pairings persist and can be restarted automatically after reboot. 

Supports multi-level/topology (you can add RAMdisk or an NVMe level over SSD) and provides runtime counters/management (so you can pull cache statistics). 


B — Secondary option

bcache (block-level SSD-as-cache) — mature, widely used, persistent block cache, easy to set up for read/write caching and exposes /sys knobs for runtime tuning. It’s a solid alternative if you prefer something simpler or already use tools that integrate with bcache. 

C — Complete architecture (what to wire together)

1. Persistent block cache

Install & configure OpenCAS (or bcache) to accelerate your slow disk(s). This gives you the persistent on-disk cache that survives reboots (metadata + cached blocks). OpenCAS has opencas.conf + casctl init|start to auto-start caches. 



2. Session profiler — record "files used" for a session

Use an eBPF-based tracer (bcc/bpftrace tools such as opensnoop or a small eBPF program) or fanotify to record per-file open/read activity for the process or session you want to optimize. eBPF gives low-overhead, high-resolution traces; fanotify is an alternative for whole-mount/file-system level logging. (If you need the simplest fallback, strace -e open,openat will record opens but with higher overhead.) 



3. Latency measurement on demand

For synthetic but precise latency/load tests use fio (produces IOPS/latency percentiles/histograms). For live measurement at the block layer use blktrace/btt or the biolatency bcc tool to produce latency histograms for device or process. Use these on demand to quantify benefit before/after warming. 



4. Analysis / ranking

From the profiler output compute per-file metrics: access count, total bytes, average IO size, aggregate latency contributed (if you correlate with blktrace/biolatency), and “benefit score” = e.g. freq_weight * access_count + io_weight * bytes / file_size - penalty_for_large_seq. Rank files by benefit-per-GB to stay memory-friendly.



5. Apply / warm / pin

Two approaches (choose based on persistence & goals):
a. Warm via block cache: read the hot files (single-threaded streaming cat/dd/pv) to cause the cache layer (OpenCAS/bcache) to pull corresponding blocks into the SSD cache. OpenCAS provides management and counters so you can verify warmed blocks. 
b. Pin into RAM for session: use vmtouch to lock chosen files into RAM (fast, immediate) while the session runs; save that hot list and re-apply at boot if you want them re-pinned automatically. vmtouch is the standard utility to inspect & lock filesystem cache regions. 



6. Persistence of “hot list”

Persist the ranked list as /var/lib/mycache/hotlist.json. Add a systemd service (or OpenCAS opencas.conf hooks) that, on boot, restarts OpenCAS/bcache and then re-applies the hotlist (either by re-warming blocks or by running vmtouch -l on the files you want pinned).



7. Closed-loop optimization

Periodically re-profile (or profile on demand), recompute rankings, and update hotlist. Use OpenCAS/bcache stats + fio/blktrace before/after a warming run to compute exact ROI (latency reduction, p50/p99 improvements).




D — Concrete starter commands & tiny bootstrap script

Install / start Open CAS (conceptual)
(install packages per distro and follow OpenCAS guide; once opencas.conf is edited:)

# Initialize caches defined in /etc/opencas/opencas.conf
sudo casctl init

# Start caches (autostartable on reboot if present in opencas.conf)
sudo casctl start

(Open CAS exposes casadm/casctl management + statistics). 

Quick latency measurement (one-off)

# Synthetic random-read latency test with fio (example)
sudo fio --name=randread-test --filename=/path/to/testfile \
  --direct=1 --rw=randread --bs=4k --size=1G --numjobs=4 \
  --time_based --runtime=30 --group_reporting

Use fio to get p50/p95/p99 latency and IOPS. 

Low-overhead session file tracing (example choices)

eBPF (bcc) opensnoop (recommended for short sessions; low overhead):


# Monitor all open syscalls (requires bcc package)
sudo opensnoop -t -p <PID> > /var/log/session-opens.log

fallback (higher overhead): strace:


strace -f -e trace=open,openat -o /tmp/trace-open.log <your_command>

(eBPF is the production-friendly approach; fanotify is another option for mount-level logging). 

Warm files into cache (two options)

Warm block cache (makes OpenCAS/bcache fetch blocks):


# naive warm: read each hot file sequentially (your analyzer will produce /var/lib/mycache/hotfiles.txt)
while read f; do
  cat "$f" > /dev/null   # or dd if you prefer; sequential read will populate cache
done < /var/lib/mycache/hotfiles.txt

Pin into RAM for session (vmtouch):


# lock hot files into RAM for the running session
sudo vmtouch -l -v $(cat /var/lib/mycache/hotfiles.txt)

vmtouch shows what is in cache and can lock regions until you remove them. 

Small Python orchestration (example)

# save as /usr/local/bin/warm_hotlist.py
import subprocess, json, sys
hotlist = '/var/lib/mycache/hotlist.json'
with open(hotlist) as f:
    files = json.load(f)['files']   # list of paths in order
# simple warm via sequential read (can be parallelized)
for p in files:
    subprocess.run(['dd', 'if='+p, 'of=/dev/null', 'bs=8M'], check=False)
# optionally pin into RAM:
subprocess.run(['vmtouch', '-l', '-v'] + files[:200])

Hook this script into a systemd unit that runs after casctl start for automatic re-warming.

E — Why this meets your three constraints

Session persistence: OpenCAS/bcache persist metadata and caches across reboots; your hotfile list is a userland artifact (JSON) saved to disk and reapplied at boot. 

Measure latency on request: fio + blktrace/biolatency provide repeatable latency/IOPS metrics; OpenCAS exposes performance counters you can read programmatically. 

Record files used & optimize for a session: eBPF/fanotify/opensnoop give per-session file access lists; your analysis component can compute benefit-per-GB and produce the hot-list that drives warming/pinning. 


F — Tradeoffs & caveats

Block-level caches (OpenCAS/bcache) are device/extent caches — they’re agnostic to filenames. That’s why you need the profiler + warmer to map file paths → block ranges and force warm/pin. OpenCAS provides management & counters to verify warming. 

Pinning with vmtouch locks RAM and is ephemeral (unless you reapply at boot). Use it for short sessions or on machines with plenty of RAM; combine with block cache for persistent acceleration. 

LVM/dm-cache can be used too but historically needs care to ensure mappings are reliably reactivated at boot — OpenCAS and bcache have more explicit tooling for persistent configs. (If you prefer LVM/dm-cache I can include a “gotchas” checklist.)



---

If you want, I can do any of the following right away (pick one and I’ll produce the files/commands inline):

1. A systemd unit + opencas.conf example that autostarts OpenCAS and re-applies a hotlist on boot.


2. A bcc / bpftrace script (production-ready) that records per-file access (with timestamps + bytes) for a named process/session.


3. A small Python analysis script that converts raw event logs into a ranked hotlist (score function included) and a systemd unit to auto-warm on boot.



Which one would you like me to generate first?
